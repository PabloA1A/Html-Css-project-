                    <h2>HTML5</h2>
                    <p>HTML5 is the fifth major revision of the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It was released in October 2014 by the W3C. HTML5 introduces new features that facilitate the handling of multimedia and graphics, as well as better interoperability between devices and platforms. Among its new features are new semantic tags such as &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;section&gt;, as well as native support for audio and video through the &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags.</p>

                    <h2>CSS3</h2>
                    <p>CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language. It brings with it a wide range of new features and capabilities, allowing web designers and developers to create more attractive and dynamic websites. Some of the most prominent features of CSS3 include animations and transitions, shadows and gradients, flexible layout properties such as Flexbox and Grid, and media queries that facilitate responsive design. CSS3 significantly improves the presentation and design control of web pages.</p>

                    <h2>JavaScript ES6</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is an enhanced version of the JavaScript programming language that introduces a number of new features to facilitate the     development of more complex and robust web applications. Among the new features in ES6 are new variable declarations (let and const), arrow functions, classes, modules, and promises that facilitate the management of asynchronous operations. These enhancements make JavaScript more efficient and easier to use for modern developers.</p>

                    <h2>Frameworks de JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript frameworks are essential tools in modern web development. They enable developers to create robust and dynamic web applications more efficiently. Some of the most popular frameworks include React, Angular and Vue.js. React, developed by Facebook, focuses on building user interfaces using reusable components. Angular, maintained by Google, is a complete framework for single-page application (SPA) development. Vue.js is known for its ease of use and flexibility, allowing developers to gradually adopt its features according to project needs.</p>

                    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
                    <p>Responsive Design is a web design technique that aims to make web pages adapt to the screen size of the device on which they are being viewed, be it a desktop computer, tablet or cell phone. This is achieved through the use of media queries, fluid layouts, and flexible units of measurement such as percentages instead of pixels. The goal of Responsive Design is to provide an optimal user experience on any device, ensuring that content is readable and easy to navigate.</p>

                    <h2>Progressive Web Apps (PWA)</h2>
                    <p>Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are web applications that use modern browser capabilities to deliver a user experience similar to that of a native application. PWAs combine the best of web apps and mobile apps, allowing offline access, push notifications, and easy installation on the user's device without the need to go through an app store. PWAs are highly optimized for performance and can be accessed via a URL, making them easy to distribute and update.</p>

                    <h2>APIs RESTful</h2>
                    <p>RESTful APIs are a type of application programming interface (API) that adhere to the constraints of the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style. These APIs allow communication between systems using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and work with resources identified by URLs. RESTful APIs are widely used in web development due to their simplicity, scalability and ability to work with various types of data, such as JSON and XML.</p>

                    <h2>WebAssembly</h2>
                    <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is an open standard that defines a portable binary format and runtime environment for applications written in programming languages such as C, C++, Rust, among others. WebAssembly allows code to run at near-native speed in web browsers, opening up new possibilities for resource-intensive applications such as games, graphical editors and scientific simulations. Wasm is interoperable with JavaScript and can be used in conjunction with other modern web technologies to enhance the performance and capabilities of web applications.</p>
